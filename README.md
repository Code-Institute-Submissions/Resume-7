## 1. The objective
There are two objectives for this project. 1) is to show the capabilities of developing an website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, and 2) to have a stand alone webiste to showcase my resume

<br>

## 2. The process
The first thing to do was to come up with a wireframe for the website, the layout and the content. See [file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VaciRuUY9jxz_yaU_lyetDOtNYmGJUjC8tjI6cjV-N8/edit?usp=sharing).

* One of the things that was important, was not to have a standard navbar. I considered this very doable since a paper resume usually also excludes a navbar, but still has a clear layout.
* In addition to a alternative navbar, there was also a demand for a timeline, without the use of JaveScript.
* As a third was some nice effects, when loading the page and when hovering.
* And finally the color scheme was to follow the colorscheme of the website of [Persumer](https://www.persumer.com/) as shown in the file above.


Initally the differend circles were planed to be used for pictures of me in different settings, me as a student, me as a garderner, me as a developer. However due to time constrains and the effort to make these pictures, we decided to only add text to the circles and only add one picture to show the person. 

<br>

## 3. Technical Accomplishments
All three demands were added to the website. Even thought the timeline was initially developed by someone else, the alternative navbar has a playfull yet clear design. And meyba more importantly is only made with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.

<br>

## 4. Additional Technology
The timeline was made by someone else: This bootstrap snippet, bs4 my experience timeline, was published on Nov 7th 2019, 07:59 by Dey Dey and it is free.

<br>

## 5. Still to add?
By the time all is appoved by Code Institute, it will be easier to add more funtionalities using JavaScript or add API's by external companies.
